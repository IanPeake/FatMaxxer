Android app for the Polar H10 to advise Detrended Fluctuation Analysis Alpha1 in real time.
There is preliminary research that running or cycling at DFA 0.75 corresponds to the first ventilatory threshold or FatMax.

Very rough, but it seems to approximate Marco Altini's Python code.

Produces audio output of HR, Alpha1 and dropped artifacts.
